                <p>Ans: SQL means the Structured Query Language which is the most common and popular programming language for  relational database management systems. It is a language which is designed to extract, store, insert, delete, update and manage data for structured data and strategic analysis.

                    NoSQL database mainly provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modelled other than table format. It was introduced by CARL STROZ in  1998. He called it a Non-relational database. Now, it is Not only for SQL. It is not limited to storing data in tables, instead, enables the big data to be stored in the structured, unstructured, semi-structured or polymorphic form.
                    <p className='text-2xl font-semibold'>NoSQL Features</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>NoSQL allows the distribution of data on more than just one device.</li>
                        <li>NoSQL has higher scalability than other database management systems</li>
                        <li>Supports Data Definition Language and Data Manipulation Language to query the databases</li>
                        <li>Does not require data normalizatio</li>
                        <li>Can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.</li>

                <p className='mt-5 font-bold'>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</p>
                <p>Ans: JSON Web Token or JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.
                    <br /> <br />
                    The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded. It is not encrypted. JWT is a token based stateless authentication system. Since it is a client side based stateless session, server doesn not have to completely rely on a datastore or database to save session information.
